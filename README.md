Here is all the pdf, code and many animation it produced from my URSS project.

If you wish to have a play with values and see what animation is produced, download both run.sh and program_v5.c
Make sure you have basilisk installed, how to install can be found here: http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL

in run.sh you can change values of  ALPHA, BETA, Q, M, D_a, c_0, a_0 and then run the script which should produce an output animation
